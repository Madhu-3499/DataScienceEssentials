This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a \\\"revenge plot\\\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \\\"I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\\\". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.\",\n          \"I mean they didn't even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copy-pasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph. Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

I remember people keep complaining about this movies being dumb however people often dismisses the the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are This time they actually went too farOnce again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that werent there Once again they got caught on a revenge plot and once again family has to come together to defeat evil They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 23 movies but this time they got lazyThe whole family is vack qith a brand new castAllan Ritchson I love the guy but he cant act to save his life He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie thoughAlison Brie the second worse actor in the entire movie has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast Its actually impressive she seem uncomfortable in every scene I dont get itJohn Cena again charming his way into making you like his character he cant act either but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob TorettoAnd Jason Momoa Just played a goofier Joker Jared Leto would be proud Hes even obsessed with the color purple Someone mustve felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of I dont wanna kill them I just want to hurt them real bad What a failure of a villain Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clownThis was overall a very dull uninteresting and boring disappointment Fast 9 shoulda been the last oneNot looking forward to the sequels to this mess not at all\",\n          \"I mean they didnt even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copypasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph Racing Victors Racing Heat Racing Rivals Racing Independence Racing Mavericks Racing Tranquility Racing Liberty Racing Bliss Racing Winners Racing Explorer Racing Heaven and many many more  and those are just the titles starting with Racing there are other obvious patterns with different title wordsThis has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews I mean its pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low and theyre that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way It also proves how little faith they have in their own film The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54 rating is a more accurate I gave it a generous 610Its too bad more effort didnt go into the writing and SVFX which needed major toning down and lacked realism as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise This was too long too slow and too cartoonish The writing was infantile like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens and Momoas character was too overboard and cant be taken in long doses They basically tried to copy The Jokers character instead of creating his own persona His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining Dont even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X They shouldve just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even numberNevertheless still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste\",\n          \"I thought they couldnt possibly write something even worse than F9 but here we areThis movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me Its just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends until the movie just ends out of nowhere Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than thisThis movie might be better than F9 for some which is understandable since its all because of Jason Momoa Hell I dont even remember a thing that happened in the last movie but I wont forget Momoas character here any time soon So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some if not most people because of Momoa but I think its worse and Momoas character gets tired and annoying really fastThe biggest problem of this movie is that the writers dont have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the family So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real family Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they

I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

wrote on the story boardThey also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you cant do anything but roll your eyes and facepalmThe movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on but the ending itself is so bad that its insulting honestlyAll of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage along with the fact that you already didnt care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9 make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 110 from me Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point But this movie sets the lowest bar possible so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast Xs script\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point.

I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point.

suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a hour movie of them doing all of thatBut these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings Ive ever seen and they feel like they werent even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable This one is particular feels like its just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story boardThey also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you cant do anything but roll your eyes and facepalmThe movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on but the ending itself is so bad that its insulting honestlyAll of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage along with the fact that you already didnt care an ounce about these characters and stories in F make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a  from me Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point But this movie sets the lowest bar possible so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast Xs script\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

went too faras far as i remember people keep complaining about this movies being dumb however people often dismisses the the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are this time they actually went too faronce again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that werent there once again they got caught on a revenge plot and once again family has to come together to defeat evil they quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last  movies but this time they got lazythe whole family is vack qith a brand new castallan ritchson i love the guy but he cant act to save his life he has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie thoughalison brie the second worse actor in the entire movie has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast its actually impressive she seem uncomfortable in every scene i dont get itjohn cena again charming his way into making you like his character he cant act either but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the jacob torettoand jason momoa just played a goofier joker jared leto would be proud hes even obsessed with the color purple someone mustve felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of i dont wanna kill them i just want to hurt them real bad what a failure of a villain jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clownthis was overall a very dull uninteresting and boring disappointment fast  shoulda been the last onenot looking forward to the sequels to this mess not at all\",\n          \"i mean they didnt even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copypasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph racing victors racing heat racing rivals racing independence racing mavericks racing tranquility racing liberty racing bliss racing winners racing explorer racing heaven and many many more  and those are just the titles starting with racing there are other obvious patterns with different title wordsthis has to be a world record for bogus chatgpt reviews i mean its pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low and theyre that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way it also proves how little faith they have in their own film the current rotten tomatoes critics  rating is a more accurate i gave it a generous its too bad more effort didnt go into the writing and svfx which needed major toning down and lacked realism as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise this was too long too slow and too cartoonish the writing was infantile like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens and momoas character was too overboard and cant be taken in long doses they basically tried to copy the jokers character instead of creating his own persona his performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining dont even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following vin diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part  of fast x they shouldve just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even numbernevertheless still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment especially if you have nothing better to do and almost  hours to waste\",\n          \"i thought they couldnt possibly write something even worse than f but here we arethis movie is just excruciating to watch and the  hours felt like a really long  hour movie to me its just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends until the movie just ends out of nowhere like even filler tv show episodes have better story structures and endings than thisthis movie might be better than f for some which is understandable since its all because of jason momoa hell i dont even remember a thing that happened in the last movie but i wont forget momoas character here any time soon so i get why this would be more watchable and better for some if not most people because of momoa but i think its worse and momoas character gets tired and annoying really fastthe biggest problem of this movie is that the writers dont have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the family so instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from fast five so they could kill them instead and make dom care about them instead of actually killing his real family because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in fast not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it like the black market scene with the ever unfunny pete davidsonthere are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy this movie is a really good cure for insomnialike if you cut  of tejromanramsey scenes nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot but then again its the only time you have a breather between the awful action scenethe story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structurecompare this to the storytelling of fast five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon its story remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were and basically ruin it its not like the old movies were masterpieces but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterizationthose movies were mediocrely written but at least they were competently mediocre with

Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

audience this way It also proves how little faith they have in their own film The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54 rating is a more accurate I gave it a generous 610Its too bad more effort didnt go into the writing and SVFX which needed major toning down and lacked realism as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise This was too long too slow and too cartoonish The writing was infantile like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens and Momoas character was too overboard and cant be taken in long doses They basically tried to copy The Jokers character instead of creating his own persona His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining Dont even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X They shouldve just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even numberNevertheless still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste\",\n          \"I thought they couldnt possibly write something even worse than F9 but here we areThis movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me Its just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends until the movie just ends out of nowhere Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than thisThis movie might be better than F9 for some which is understandable since its all because of Jason Momoa Hell I dont even remember a thing that happened in the last movie but I wont forget Momoas character here any time soon So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some if not most people because of Momoa but I think its worse and Momoas character gets tired and annoying really fastThe biggest problem of this movie is that the writers dont have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the family So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real family Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete DavidsonThere are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy This movie is a really good cure for insomniaLike if you cut 90 of TejRomanRamsey scenes nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot But then again its the only time you have a breather between the awful action sceneThe story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structureCompare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon its story remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were and basically ruin it Its not like the old movies were masterpieces but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterizationThose movies were mediocrely written but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2hour movie of them doing all of thatBut these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings Ive ever seen and they feel like they werent even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable This one is particular feels like its just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story boardThey also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you cant do anything but roll your eyes and facepalmThe movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on but the ending itself is so bad that its insulting honestlyAll of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage along with the fact that you already didnt care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9 make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 110 from me Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point But this movie sets the lowest bar possible so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast Xs script\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Once again they got caught on a \\\"revenge plot\\\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \\\"I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\\\". What a failure of a villain.

I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point.

actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree they were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a hour movie of them doing all of thatbut these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings ive ever seen and they feel like they werent even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable this one is particular feels like its just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story boardthey also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you cant do anything but roll your eyes and facepalmthe movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on but the ending itself is so bad that its insulting honestlyall of that with a lot of other problems that i do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage along with the fact that you already didnt care an ounce about these characters and stories in f make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a  from me somehow i feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced so we have to wait and see but i doubt anyone could save this at this point but this movie sets the lowest bar possible so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than fast xs script\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a \\\"revenge plot\\\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \\\"I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\\\". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.\",\n          \"I mean they didn't even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copy-pasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph. Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

of creating his own persona His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining Dont even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X They shouldve just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even numberNevertheless

This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a \\\"revenge plot\\\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \\\"I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\\\". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.\",\n          \"I mean they didn't even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copy-pasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph. Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

to defeat evil They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 23 movies but this time they got lazyThe whole family is vack qith a brand new castAllan Ritchson I love the guy but he cant act to

something on the lines of I dont wanna kill them I just want to hurt them real bad What a failure of a villain Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clownThis was overall a very

wordsThis has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews I mean its pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low and theyre that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way It also proves how little faith they have in their own film The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54 rating is a more accurate I gave it a generous 610Its too bad more effort didnt go into the writing and SVFX which needed major toning down and lacked realism as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise This was too long too slow and too cartoonish The writing was infantile like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens and Momoas character was too overboard and cant be taken in long doses They basically tried to copy The Jokers character instead of creating his own persona His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining Dont even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X They shouldve just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even numberNevertheless still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste\",\n          \"I thought they couldnt possibly write something even worse than F9 but here we areThis movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me Its just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends until the movie just ends out of nowhere Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than thisThis movie might be better than F9 for some which is understandable since its all because of Jason Momoa Hell I dont even remember a thing that happened in the last movie but I wont forget Momoas character here any time soon So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some if not most people because of Momoa but I think its worse and Momoas character gets tired and annoying really fastThe biggest problem of this movie is that the writers dont have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the family So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real family Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete DavidsonThere are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy This movie is a really good cure for insomniaLike if you cut 90 of TejRomanRamsey scenes nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot But then again its the only time you have a breather between the awful action sceneThe story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structureCompare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon its story remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were and basically ruin it Its not like the old movies were masterpieces but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterizationThose movies were mediocrely written but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2hour movie of them doing all of thatBut these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings Ive ever seen and they feel like they werent even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable This one is particular feels like its just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story boardThey also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you cant do anything but roll your eyes and facepalmThe movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on but the ending itself is so bad that its insulting honestlyAll of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage along with the fact that you already didnt care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9 make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 110 from me Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point But this movie sets the lowest bar possible so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast Xs script\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a \\\"revenge plot\\\" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of \\\"I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad\\\". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.\",\n          \"I mean they didn't even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copy-pasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph. Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.\",\n          \"I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the \\\"family\\\". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real \\\"family\\\". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable.

Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point.

to defeat evil They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 23 movies but this time they got lazyThe whole family is vack qith a brand new castAllan Ritchson I love the guy but he cant act to

something on the lines of I dont wanna kill them I just want to hurt them real bad What a failure of a villain Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clownThis was overall a very

wordsThis has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews I mean its pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low and theyre that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way It also proves how little faith they have in their own film The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54 rating is a more accurate I gave it a generous 610Its too bad more effort didnt go into the writing and SVFX which needed major toning down and lacked realism as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise This was too long too slow and too cartoonish The writing was infantile like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens and Momoas character was too overboard and cant be taken in long doses They basically tried to copy The Jokers character instead of creating his own persona His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining Dont even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X They shouldve just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even numberNevertheless still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste\",\n          \"I thought they couldnt possibly write something even worse than F9 but here we areThis movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me Its just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends until the movie just ends out of nowhere Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than thisThis movie might be better than F9 for some which is understandable since its all because of Jason Momoa Hell I dont even remember a thing that happened in the last movie but I wont forget Momoas character here any time soon So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some if not most people because of Momoa but I think its worse and Momoas character gets tired and annoying really fastThe biggest problem of this movie is that the writers dont have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the family So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real family Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete DavidsonThere are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy This movie is a really good cure for insomniaLike if you cut 90 of TejRomanRamsey scenes nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot But then again its the only time you have a breather between the awful action sceneThe story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structureCompare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon its story remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were and basically ruin it Its not like the old movies were masterpieces but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterizationThose movies were mediocrely written but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2hour movie of them doing all of thatBut these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings Ive ever seen and they feel like they werent even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable This one is particular feels like its just a collage of some random bs they

        "In natural language processing, constituency parsing and dependency parsing are methods for examining sentence structures. Constituency parsing is the process of dissecting a sentence into phrases or constituents in a hierarchical manner. This allows the grammatical structure to be shown using a tree-like representation, in which nodes stand in for constituents. The syntactic components of the sentence \"The cat chased the mouse,\" for example, might be illustrated by a constituency parse tree, which would disclose a hierarchical structure like (S (NP (Det The) (N cat)) (VP (V chased) (NP (Det the) (N mouse))). Dependency parsing, on the other hand, creates a tree with each word as a node and edges indicating syntactic dependencies, concentrating on the grammatical links between words. The dependency parse tree for the same example can provide relationships like \"chased\" based on \"cat\" and \"mouse,\" providing insights."
